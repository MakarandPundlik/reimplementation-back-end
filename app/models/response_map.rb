# The ResponseMap model represents the association between reviewers and reviewees for a specific assignment. 
# In Expertiza, this model allows participants (students) to assess each otherâ€™s work, acting as a map or link
# between reviewers (who perform evaluations) and reviewees (who are evaluated). This mapping is key to facilitating 
# peer assessments, as it connects specific reviewers to their assigned reviewees within an assignment. 
# The ResponseMap model provides various methods to retrieve responses based on factors like the team being reviewed, 
# the reviewer, or the assignment.

class ResponseMap < ApplicationRecord
  # Relationships:
  # - A ResponseMap can have multiple responses, forming a one-to-many association with the Response model.
  # - It belongs to a reviewer and reviewee, both represented by the Participant model.
  # - It also belongs to an assignment, where each response map is tied to a specific assignment being reviewed.

  # Simplifies access to the reviewer's fullname and the assignment's name attributes
